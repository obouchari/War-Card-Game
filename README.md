## Story

One of our developers, Phil Browne, was sharing his story. War was the very first card game Phil learned as a child -- taught to him by his grandmother. They used to play every time he visited for Thanksgiving. His grandmother was always very kind and generous, but when War was on the table, Grandma showed absolutely no mercy. Phil quickly learned the hard way that *#GrandmaAlwaysWins*

We thought it would be great to have an online version of this game. Prepare yourself for **Card Wars**, and *may the cards be with you...*

## Rules

1. Each player will be dealt 26 cards each (half of the deck). Cards are face down.
2. Both players flip one card at the same time, who has the higher value wins. That person takes both cards and adds them to their deck.
3. Keep repeating step 2. If both players flip a card of equal value, WAR begins! Both players take three cards and turn over their third card. Whichever player's third card has the highest value wins the war and takes all six cards.
4. If both new cards are also the same rank, it's WAR again, but the stakes are even higher as three more cards are added to the pile from each player! Repeat step 3 until one of the players has a third card of higher value. The winner will take all of the war cards.
5. The game will have a four minute timer. Once time expires, the player with the most cards wins the game.
6. If a player runs out of cards before time expires, they lose the game.
7. If the score is tied when time expires, a two minute Overtime period will begin. If the game is still tied after Overtime, the game will go into an additional Overtime, and this process will repeat until there is a winner.
8. Player Characters: Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Yoda, R2D2, C3PO, BB-8, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Mace Windu, and Obi Wan Kenobi.
9. Computer Characters: Darth Vader, Darth Maul, Boba Fett, Storm Trooper, Emperor Palpatine, Kylo Ren, and Jabba the Hutt
